# About me

This is a mockup site called "About me", which also has a guessing game to try some JS with.

## lab 02

Made some pages like "Education history" and "Job experience", but most importantly added the "Guessing Game" and added 5 questions to it.

Added some CSS, made checking if the answer you gave is correct or not easier with extra text that is color (a green "That's correct" and a red "That's wrong").
