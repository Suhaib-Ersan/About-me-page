# About me

This is a mockup site called "About me", which also has a guessing game to try some JS with.

## lab 02

Added Education history and Job experience, but most importantly added the "Guessing Game" and added 5 questions to it.

Added some CSS, made checking if the answer you gave is correct or not easier with extra text that is color (a green "That's correct" and a red "That's wrong").

## lab 03 

Made Education history and Job experience into seperate pages which are put in an unordered list menu of the left. 

Added "Top 10" ordered list to the bottom of the now called "About me" page, which is the index.
